# ❤️ Heart Attack Risk Analysis  
*Using data to understand and predict cardiovascular risk*

---

## 🩺 Project Motivation
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.  
This project analyzes a medical dataset to identify patterns and factors that may contribute to heart attack risk using data science techniques.

The goal is to gain insights from patient data and explore its potential for predictive modeling.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview
- File Name: `Medicaldataset.csv`
- Domain: Healthcare / Medical Data
- Type: Structured tabular data

The dataset contains patient-related medical attributes used for heart attack risk assessment.

## 🧾 Key Features
The dataset includes parameters such as:
- Age and gender
- Medical indicators (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol)
- Lifestyle-related factors
- Target variable indicating heart attack risk

*(Exact features may vary based on dataset source)*
